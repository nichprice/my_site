        <p>Nothing says I'm ready to crush some code or talk F1 quite like the smell of freshly ground beans brewing in a moka pot. </p>
        <p>I love to solve algorithms. The feeling of successfully working your way through a complex problem never gets old. Check out my YouTube channel where I break down algorithms step by step and explain the logic along the way.</p>
